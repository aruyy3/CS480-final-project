Seizure Detection System


Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures that affect
millions of people worldwide.

Detecting and predicting epileptic seizures accurately plays a crucial role in managing the condition
and improving the quality of life for individuals affected by epilepsy.

In recent years, machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools for automated seizure
detection, providing a potential solution to the challenges associated with manual diagnosis and
monitoring.

The primary objective of this project is to build a robust classification model capable of accurately
distinguishing between seizure and non-seizure events using relevant physiological data, such as
electroencephalography (EEG) signals.
