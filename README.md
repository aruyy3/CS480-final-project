Seizure Detection System

# Introduction 
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures that affect
millions of people worldwide.

Detecting and predicting epileptic seizures accurately plays a crucial role in managing the condition
and improving the quality of life for individuals affected by epilepsy.


The primary objective of this project is to build a robust classification model capable of accurately
distinguishing between seizure and non-seizure events using relevant physiological data, such as
electroencephalography (EEG) signals.


# Project Requirements
These are the main features and functions our system should have.

Requirements:

- Save and manage EEG data.
- Let users (like doctors and patients) see seizure prediction results.
- Send real-time alerts when a seizure is detected.
- Show visual charts or graphs of EEG data trends.
