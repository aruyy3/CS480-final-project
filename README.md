Seizure Detection System

# Introduction 
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures that affect
millions of people worldwide.

Detecting and predicting epileptic seizures accurately plays a crucial role in managing the condition
and improving the quality of life for individuals affected by epilepsy.

In recent years, machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools for automated seizure
detection, providing a potential solution to the challenges associated with manual diagnosis and
monitoring.

The primary objective of this project is to build a robust classification model capable of accurately
distinguishing between seizure and non-seizure events using relevant physiological data, such as
electroencephalography (EEG) signals.


# Project Requirements
These are the main features and functions our system should have.

Functional Requirements:

- Save and manage EEG data.
- Let users (like doctors and patients) see seizure prediction results.
- Send real-time alerts when a seizure is detected.
- Show visual charts or graphs of EEG data trends.
- Include a machine learning model to predict seizures.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- Be available and reliable so users can depend on it.
- Meet performance goals, like fast response times for predictions.
- Keep sensitive health data secure.
- Be easy to use for different types of users, like doctors and patients.
